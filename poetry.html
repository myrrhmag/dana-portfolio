    <h2>Mishneh Torah: Hilkhot De’ot Chapter 1</h2>
    <pre>
It was said of those who followed the way of the Name:
Alight, those sages seemed, as by a righteous fire, 
which never plunged in either direction, not towards anger or placidity, 
but which burned with a constant tremor for the Name. 
Light as the hand of the teacher, which rests considerably upon the holy book, 
they were, like one whose words are crisp and soothing 
as the bite of an apple, the turn of a page. 
Wise, as one who keeps quiet, neighborly, like a fleet of angels
Gracious, like orange blossom and jasmine archways
Merciful as one who has sinned much in his youth
And holy, like young love in pursuit of a full moon. 
So they were, those sages, and so they seemed.

    <h2>Jailhouse of Divine Blessing
It’s not always going to be
car ride revelations, wind spun meditations,
mischief in the foyer.
There won’t always be 
rooftops for musing, rivers for roaming, 
nor tall grass for sneaking. 
Sometimes there’s got to be grey cement walls 
and cold concrete floors, 
lonely ghosts wailing on an empty moon.  

Ethereal time-out, jailhouse of divine blessing, 
your God has sentenced you. 
Now you could stand there, rattling the prison bars, 
howling till your voice grows sore, 
or you could grab a harmonica, 
and play a little tune.
& you could always pound your head against the wall, 
forlorn and bellowing “where is my purpose??”,
or you could sprawl out across the floor 
and let the earth pass through you. 

There’s a guy in my office,
and each time he answers his desk phone, 
he declares, “Hello,  
you are speaking to the illusion of me, 
how can I help you today?”
and who could blame him?
Then there’s that online creep whose instagram reads:
“messiah,
dumped by my wife.” So yeah, there’s that too. 

Tell me, who has known a jailhouse devoid of hilarity, 
or bereft of that matter most human of all 
which hints, hinting always, of stars and many microscopic things, 
like an old man eating an ice cream cone, alone and at ease, sewn to the park bench,
mothers & fistfuls of cherries, purple doves flying in twos,
thoughts which lift you as though by a string, 
cast by celestial bodies,  
drawing you up by the naval, onwards, 
to heaven and the likes, out past the walls of this fleeting confinement
