    <h2>Mishneh Torah: Hilkhot Deâ€™ot Chapter 1</h2>
    <pre>
It was said of those who followed the way of the Name:
Alight, those sages seemed, as by a righteous fire, 
which never plunged in either direction, not towards anger or placidity, 
but which burned with a constant tremor for the Name. 
Light as the hand of the teacher, which rests considerably upon the holy book, 
they were, like one whose words are crisp and soothing 
as the bite of an apple, the turn of a page. 
Wise, as one who keeps quiet, neighborly, like a fleet of angels
Gracious, like orange blossom and jasmine archways
Merciful as one who has sinned much in his youth
And holy, like young love in pursuit of a full moon. 
So they were, those sages, and so they seemed.
    </pre>
